# SQL Scripts
A small repo of reusable and descriptive scripts for raw SQL.

1. Basics - Select statements, asterisk (*) selector, columns, WHERE statements, AND/OR qualifiers, NOT qualifiers, DISTINCT to extract unique values in columns.

2. Filtering & Sorting - Order By statements, Null qualifiers, RegEX patterns, Wildcards, Alias, Between & IN qualifiers and Groups. "WHERE" does not work with aggregate functions but "HAVING" does.

3. Inserting & Updating - Standard data updates, manipulation and deletion.
